Regular expressions
-------------------
The options -t (a/o -to and -tl) and -k (a/o -ko and -kl) need regular expressions as values.
such as
#
-k latex                matches all topic names which contain "latex"
-t "latex|ltx|l3|lt3"   matches all file names which contain "latex", "ltx", "l3" or "t3"
-t "^.+$"               matches all file names
-t "^{a-b]"             matches all file names which begin with letters a-b
