wget
====

All programs in the Convert_CTAN bundle (CTANLoad.py, CTANOut.py, CTANLoadOut.py, and 
menu_CTANLoadOut.py) use wget for downloading. 
The best way is to use GNU wget (https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/ for some platforms)

wget has to be installed in the current folder or in the path.

Note:
There is a Python script with the name wget, too. 
But there is no chance to use it in an equivalent way like the GNU product.
